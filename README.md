# day-tracker
to keep my day organized

## Discription

This was a already built web page that i added some javascript to. I took the CSS file colors add them so that it interacts with live
time. That you can see the colors depending on the hours in the day. Added a save button to it so when you put in information it says on page even 
if you refresh. 


## Installation

-Select a time slot. 
-Put information in the on right hand side click on lock to lock in your text.
-There will be colors on the page gray,red, and green.
-The colors are for the hours of the day.
-green is for the time that has not past yet.
-Red is the time now.
-Gray is the time that past.
-If you refresh the page your text will stay on page unless you delete it and click the lock button.


## usage
